F1R3~
Stand before the statue of the Sphinx, guardian of ancient wisdom and keeper of timeless secrets. Listen closely as it poses a riddle, its eyes gleaming with the light of ages past. Delve into the depths of your mind and unearth the answer, for only those who solve its enigma shall be deemed worthy to tread further upon the path of destiny. The player must interact with the statue of the Sphinx to input their answer. If the correct answer is provided, the Sphinx's eyes glow with an ethereal light, and the door to the next chamber unlocks. If the answer is incorrect, the Sphinx emits a low growl, and the player must try again or search for additional clues hidden within the room.~
The room is adorned with ancient hieroglyphs and a statue of a Sphinx. Engraved on a stone tablet nearby is a riddle posed by the Sphinx. To proceed, the player must solve the riddle and provide the correct answer. Riddle: "I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?"~
